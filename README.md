# google-map-history-view

google timeline is changing to be on device only - this was due to some lawsuits

so it is a hassle to see your historical data

you may have to jump through a few hoops on your device to get your data but ultimately you should be able to get a 'location-history.json' file that contains your movements through space and time...  if you can get that far then this index.html web page can view your data... you may also need to run a tiny local server to get around some security issues but generally this is a simpler solution than other solutions and you can tweak as needed
